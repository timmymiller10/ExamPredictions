## Introduction

In this code, I will be walking through a dataset of Exam Scores alone with other characterisitcs. The purpose is to create a model
to predict what a persons exam score will be, based off of the other attributes given in the dataset. 

I will start by using a simply lm() model, followed by a model derived from the `library(caret)` package in R
